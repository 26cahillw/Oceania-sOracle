            <p>Baghdad, Iraq - Years after the Iraq war that began twenty one years ago, the claim of “weapons of mass destruction” persists in the memory of the world. Even with the fog of war and the hind sight that comes with looking at an event twenty years ago, we must not forget the effects of the rules based order that the U. S. upheld in Iraq.</p>

                <p>    This Peace coming from Saddam Husseins’s Iraq will never attain “WMDs” and therefore append the rules based global order that the U.S. gained so much from. Clearly, this truth must be known to fully comprehend the reason why our nation started a war with a country across the world. This world, based on the rule of law and justice, needs violence to uphold these values we hold fiercely. Operation Iraqi Freedom proves the necessity within American foreign policy to uphold freedom and democracy to only one country despite all the countries in the world having some human rights issues. Ultimately, the average American that ultimately paid the most, and continues to pay the developing nations who must choose these tyrannical governments which call upon America to liberate them. It ultimately is up to these nations to choose whether or not they want humanitarian crises, war crimes and protracted societal collapse by arbitrarily violating the mandates of the most preeminent global power. </p>
                
               <p>    The Iraqis should be grateful for the "any means necessary" doctrine, as only limited the amount of “illegal detainment, torture and psyops such as collective punishment”. We “were greeted as liberators” despite killing a million innocents, and being charged with physical abuse, sexual humiliation, physical and psychological torture, and rape, as well the killing desecration of bodies. Ultimately our ignorance is strength to further our resolve in freeing the Iraqi people, even though the American public didn’t know about these necessary events. Many people criticized this war for taking away any sort of popular sovereignty from the Iraqi people, however I say that there is no difference between a brutal native authoritarian government vs. a liberating occupying authoritarian government. There is no difference between freedom and slavery for the Iraqi people, therefore why shouldn't we force our ideology onto them. In the end, Twenty One years later, we should be grateful for this war and the lasting credibility and as we went from. Just as our president who led us through this war said “Absolutely, we’re winning.' Two months later, he told the Washington Post: 'We’re not winning, we’re not losing”. </p>
                
                <p>    New York City, United States - Living in the big city, I am surrounded by people with many different opinions, perspectives and values. That is one of the reasons I think Cities are such a vital asset to our discourse as we must share the same space with people who can. </p>

            <h2>What does a society without logic look like?</h2>
            <p>Author: The Ministry of Truth</p>
            <p>
                Ever since the invention of logic, by Borat himself, in ancient Rome, during the period now referred to as the Renaissance, people have always taken it for granted. Logic did not always exist in such sophisticated means as today, again, thanks to the logistician, and maize farmer Borat and his comrade, Tom. Additionally, logic can be lacking in certain areas, due to a variety of factors, such as lack of proper education. Logical fallacies are most commonly identified when they contradict each other, however the concept of contradiction was actually invented in 700 AD by Sir Logic himself. 
                Logic bridges the gaps between facts, and opinions. Series of strings of logic allow us to compare, contrast, isolate and extrapolate the facts that we know, into the opinions that we believe. These opinions, then, are used to actively inform our conscience, further changing how we act. Logic also allows us to break things down into smaller pieces, and unite them in different ways, similar to building a puzzle. For example, we can break down the previous paragraph, and draw the conclusion that a person’s facts, in combination with a person’s logic, inform a person’s opinions and therefore weigh on a person’s actions. Therefore, the concept of brainwashing is potentially far more dangerous than we might initially assume, due to the fact that these facts will in turn cause biases in the actions of this individual. 
                Now, the actual creator of logic, or at least a major contributor to its study was Aristotle. One of the main forms of logic that he invented was the Hypothetical syllogism, which essentially, is a statement following the order of: if statement, then statement. These can also be compiled together to form a series of logic. For example: If I do not wake up, I cannot go to school. And if I cannot go to school, then I cannot learn. Therefore concluding, if I do not wake up, I cannot learn. He also invented temporal modal logic, which in essence, is the idea that the truth or what can be logically identified as such, changes with time. For example the statement: I am sixteen, will not always be true, as time will change it to false. 
                Critical thinking, something that we are often graded on in both History and English and arguably even all other subject areas, is something that was invented by Plato and Socrates, once again, in Ancient Greece. Critical thinking is simply the process of analyzing a series of facts into one sound conclusion. 
                Historically, logic birthed in all major civilizations, possibly due to its necessity, similar to the way that mathematics was created, as it was necessary to calculate taxes, in order to collect them. Even more primitively, it was necessary to keep the records of grain storage, such as the Quipu system, originating from the ancient Incas, invented to keep tax records, census information and various other forms of data.  
                If this previous paragraph is correct. Then, it would be plausible that the very existence of a complex society or civilization, requires the need of logic. Inversely (a mathematical logic system invented in 1813), without the presence of logic, society cannot exist. In more related terminology, the concept of newspeak is entirely impossible, as it cannot exist within any human society.

            <h2>How are human thoughts limited by language and its lack of words?</h2>
            <p>Author: The Ministry of Truth</p>
            <p>
                Ministry of Truth
                    Have you ever felt that feeling when you just can’t think of the word? You have such an intense thought, but no way to express it? The question that bothers me is, what if there is a whole realm of these thoughts, laying somewhere, beyond the reach of our limited minds?
                Diving into the linguistic elements of this question, there is actually a term for the argument that thought is directly correlated with the language of an individual, Linguistic Determinism. This is a smaller section of a wider argument, around the central theme that humans preserve the world through the structure of language that they use, commonly referred to as Linguistic Relativism. 
                Guugu Yimithirr, is a language that lays at the heart of Linguistic Relativism arguments. In the language, there is no concept of left and right, rather everything is viewed in its geocentric direction (North, East, South, West). Speakers of this language are able to identify the geocentric direction of people, places and things with incredible accuracy and memory. This indicates that the way in which their language is formatting, changes the structure of how they remember details and what details they remember. Or in other words, this is an example in which the language of the individual alters or slights the way in which said individual preserves things. 
                Pirahã, is a language that originates from the Amazon, in which the concept of math, seemed to researchers to be out of the realm of the language. The language only contains words for “none”, “some” and many”, but lacks any numerical system or math. Native speakers were taught for eight months, and by the end, were still incapable of counting from one to ten. Which reaffirms the theory that language might actually hinder thought, or at least the understanding of thought. But, notably, they were taught to count from one to ten in Portuguese, this isolates the fact that language restricts the ability to think. A more refined thesis would be that the native tongue of an individual inhibits that individual's understanding of certain concepts. 
                Unfortunately, this point of language limiting thought is actually denounced by a majority of linguisticians. They make the argument that just because there isn’t exactly a word for something does not mean that there is not a way of expressing it. For example, I cannot give you one word to describe how much I love my dog, I would need a few sentences to do so. 
                Philosophically, the famous philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, seemed in his works to agree with the Linguistic Determinism theory, in which he coined the phrase “Language as a prison.” 
                A modern example of this is the newly revamped word, “gaslight”, which has come to express the relationship of a perpetrator, conscious of their wrongdoing, denying, advertising or in any way dodging the direct confrontation of their victim. The term has been so widely used, mainly due to its word-economy advantages, as it drastically reduced the amount of words required to describe such a feeling.
