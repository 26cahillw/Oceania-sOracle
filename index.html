            <h2>The NSA Is Stealing Your Thoughts And Saving Lives</h2>
                <p>
                    The reach of the NSA’s surveillance capabilities is an unprecedented element of society today that penetrates even the most secure conversations and weaves its way into the thoughts of all Americans. Some are calling it a gross invasion of privacy while others disagree, referencing the statistics of drastically dropping murder rates and the prevention of violent crimes. With technological advancements in no short supply, the NSA is able to access more and more of the average American’s life with each passing day. Today we are in an age where to even think about committing a crime would almost certainly result in the police on your doorstep the very next day.
                    Many Americans argue that the right to privacy is one of the foundational principles of our nation and the government should not be allowed to monitor its citizens 24/7. However, despite the large percentage of the population pushing back, there are also many, including numerous politicians, who believe that this kind of regulation is necessary to combat the constant crime issue we face in the United States. In fact, since the implementation of murder prevention protocols, murder rates of all degrees have dropped to an all-time low, and other felonies have reduced by 45%. 
                    As for those on the other side of the debate, they claim that this kind of action by the government is an abuse of power and a severe overstep onto the rights of private citizens. They argue that, with the NSA capable of this kind of violating surveillance, the United States government is destroying the very ground it was built on. This sort of intrusion from previous governments in other nations was a large part of the inspiration for creating a country so free as the United States. Not only does this breach each individual's right to privacy, but it is also important to emphasize the fact that many of these people are arrested before crimes are even committed, placing significant trust in unreliable technology.
                    While there are undoubtedly merits to both arguments, it comes down to the best interests of the people and where Americans draw the line where security crosses over into oppression. Where do the benefits outweigh the significant hits to American freedom and liberty? This will be up to the American people to protest or affirm; the NSA is saving lives, but is it worth it at the cost of your thoughts?

            <h2> A Look into the Impact of Media Globally</h2>
            <p> 
                With election season right around the corner, it is extremely essential to recognize the way that different governments streamline information, or try to limit the sources which people can get their information from. This gatekeeping of information for a government's benefit is especially present in the country of North Korea, which continues to wrestle the constant battle between freedom of the press and what the government wants to convey to the people.
	            Technically, freedom of the press is written into the North Korean constitution, however, despite this written promise, the government has done everything in their power to limit the freedom of the press. For example, although North Korea has a pattern of famine and economic hardship, these issues are not acknowledged by the government, and are instead ignored, while the public consistently gets word from the government about extreme technological advancements or improvements made due to the leaders “revolutionary thinking”. This results in an attempted brainwashing of the people of North Korea, in a constant attempt to drill in the idea that the government is all-knowing and can do no wrong.
	            Korea clearly attempts to gain control of not only the news put out into the world, but stemming from that, they also try to gain control of the thoughts in people’s heads. This is clearly shown by the extremely stringent control that the dictator (Kim Jong Un) has over the radio, television, and even printed news. The television and radios given out to the people of North Korea have to be checked by police before being given out, and have pre-controlled and set stations that are limited to the government controlled ones. This also includes any foreign channels, as the government of North Korea wants to isolate its country's news, in order to hopefully maintain the stringent hold that this leadership has over its people.
	            This withholding of information in North Korea also is displayed by the withholding of internet access. Although the government phone ban was lifted in 2008, internet access is still contained in very small sections of North Korea, mostly including the upper class and elite. In these sections, there is access to social media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter.
                It is extremely important to recognize that by restricting internet and access to different technologies and news sources, the leadership of North Korea is attempting to limit the access that the citizens of North Korea have to different perspectives and thoughts, and therefore they are attempting to constrict and conform the thoughts of North Korean citizens, and gain control of their actions and freedom. This is a very important thing to recognize, because by limiting the thoughts and actions of those who bring innovation and critical thinking to the country and world, you are therefore limiting the growth and development of your own country, and stunting the thoughts of those who have the ability to think outside the box. This is why freedom of press is so important, and North Korea will not be able to grow and succeed the same as other nations without the free spread of information.

            <h2>What does a society without logic look like?</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since the invention of logic, by Borat himself, in ancient Rome, during the period now referred to as the Renaissance, people have always taken it for granted. Logic did not always exist in such sophisticated means as today, again, thanks to the logistician, and maize farmer Borat and his comrade, Tom. Additionally, logic can be lacking in certain areas, due to a variety of factors, such as lack of proper education. Logical fallacies are most commonly identified when they contradict each other, however the concept of contradiction was actually invented in 700 AD by Sir Logic himself. 
                Logic bridges the gaps between facts, and opinions. Series of strings of logic allow us to compare, contrast, isolate and extrapolate the facts that we know, into the opinions that we believe. These opinions, then, are used to actively inform our conscience, further changing how we act. Logic also allows us to break things down into smaller pieces, and unite them in different ways, similar to building a puzzle. For example, we can break down the previous paragraph, and draw the conclusion that a person’s facts, in combination with a person’s logic, inform a person’s opinions and therefore weigh on a person’s actions. Therefore, the concept of brainwashing is potentially far more dangerous than we might initially assume, due to the fact that these facts will in turn cause biases in the actions of this individual. 
                Now, the actual creator of logic, or at least a major contributor to its study was Aristotle. One of the main forms of logic that he invented was the Hypothetical syllogism, which essentially, is a statement following the order of: if statement, then statement. These can also be compiled together to form a series of logic. For example: If I do not wake up, I cannot go to school. And if I cannot go to school, then I cannot learn. Therefore concluding, if I do not wake up, I cannot learn. He also invented temporal modal logic, which in essence, is the idea that the truth or what can be logically identified as such, changes with time. For example the statement: I am sixteen, will not always be true, as time will change it to false. 
                Critical thinking, something that we are often graded on in both History and English and arguably even all other subject areas, is something that was invented by Plato and Socrates, once again, in Ancient Greece. Critical thinking is simply the process of analyzing a series of facts into one sound conclusion. 
                Historically, logic birthed in all major civilizations, possibly due to its necessity, similar to the way that mathematics was created, as it was necessary to calculate taxes, in order to collect them. Even more primitively, it was necessary to keep the records of grain storage, such as the Quipu system, originating from the ancient Incas, invented to keep tax records, census information and various other forms of data.  
                If this previous paragraph is correct. Then, it would be plausible that the very existence of a complex society or civilization, requires the need of logic. Inversely (a mathematical logic system invented in 1813), without the presence of logic, society cannot exist. In more related terminology, the concept of newspeak is entirely impossible, as it cannot exist within any human society.

            <h2> What are the negative effects of modern technology upon society? </h2>
                <p>
                    San Francisco, USA - Hello readers from around the globe, I am here today to tell you why all of this new technology and especially AI is so amazing and how it is going to lead our country, and even our world forward. As we all start to use newspeak I think AI could be even more fully integrated into society. This is a message to not just people but even more so the government as to why this technology needs to be pushed to even its furthest limits. You don’t even have to think and study anymore, all your work can be done for you. You can now have a career in any sort of topic without even needing to waste so much time learning from useless textbooks and wasting years of your life in the academic world.
                    It is also easier than ever for you to block out what you don't want to hear and just find the information you are looking for without constantly being distracted by contradictory views and information. The flow of information has never been more streamlined and information has never been more readily available.  All of this is fantastic with even the information being shown to you know being shown by an algorithm, no need for digging through piles of trash to find one piece of treasure, you can now have an advanced search engine calculate exactly what you want and when you want it.
                    For the vocal minority of radical people living in fear, I'm here for people to once again return to normalcy. I find it understandable to feel somewhat reserved about AI in particular because it is extremely new, but the idea that it could possibly be used in a bad way is incredibly misguided. Just the other day I read this fantastic article published by Microsoft on all the restrictions and things they are doing to protect us. It was so detailed I began to lose even the smallest inkling of doubt of these so-called dangers. Even if you feel like there is some sort of perceived danger, it is just so useful and now you no longer need to look through tons of information, you can find it all just from one source which saves so much time and energy. AI is completely safe to use you all have nothing to worry about, Uncle Sam has told us it is safe and he is always right. 
                    I also have some friends and even co workers struggling with the idea and falsified belief that your technology is listening or tracking you in some way. This is absolutely ridiculous, GPS is so integral to daily life that what they do with it, does not really matter at all. This idea that AI and all this new technology are unsafe is completely falsified by many terrorists and evil cyber criminals. Your alexas are completely safe and you have nothing to worry about. You are all completely safe in the hands of the government, I will remind you all how “The US government can harness the power of AI and advance this technology safely.” This is the very obvious path forward to move this country towards the world we all want. I am here to remind you as well, all you have to do is utilize doublethink and all your problems go away. I know we all wish to move forward as a nation and continue to be the strongest in the world. AI and this new tech are the most important tools for leading us into a utopia and if we don't utilize them we will be swiftly left in the past.

            <h2>   US Mexico Border Security, And Our Tense History At The Rio Grande.  </h2>
                <p>
	                One important topic of this year’s presidential election has been security at the southern border. It seems that both presidential candidates have their own unique opinions on how to best tackle the problem at the border. Current President Biden believes that anyone who attempts to cross the border illegally should be pushed away, and forced to attempt to legally obtain citizenship. On the other hand, former President Trump hopes to solve the crisis at the border via more harsh measures, such as the mass detainment and deportation of any and all who attempt to cross the border illegally. 
	                But, our troubled history at the border is no recent topic. In fact, it has been an issue since the Cold War, when the US and Mexico fought for nearly 30 years in a bloody conflict over significant land disputes.
                    Following the end of World War 2 in 1945, World powers met in France to codify the Paris Peace Treaties, discuss war reparations, and newly divided borders. But, Mexico was not content with the outlined terms, such as having to relinquish control of Texas and the Southwest. 
                    For months they secretly plotted an act of aggression against the United States, and on October 18th, 1949, Mexico ignited the Cold War, shocking US troops with a surprise attack of combined ground and air assault. Squadrons of bombers descended upon Los Angeles, Austin, and Maimi. Paratroopers landed across the US Mexico border, in an attempt to reach ground superiority. The following month of November was the bloodiest of the nearly 30 year long conflict, with over 2 million deaths, 650,000 of which were US civilians: a clear violation of the Geneva Treaty. However, the US remained ethical in its fighting, only resulting in the casualties of 80,000 Mexican civilians. 
                    Not sure who to support, many world powers chose not to pick a side in the conflict, seeing it as a feud that should not expand beyond North America. But, the effects of this conflict were clearly visible throughout the rest of the world, with many nations falling into recessions, their economies weakened by the war across the ocean. By 1957, Mexican forces had captured as many as 20 states, and had forced the United States to relocate its capital to New York City. 
                    Though it seemed that all hope was lost for the US, there had seemed to be light at the end of the tunnel. Nuclear physicists based out of Philadelphia had spent years researching atomic fission, and its potentially lethal capabilities. In the early 70’s, Robert Oppenheimer oversaw the successful detonation of the first atomic bomb prototype, which was tested in the Mojave desert. 
                    Then, in the early morning hours of February 13, 1974, the atomic bomb was detonated over the city of Mexico City, resulting in the casualties of nearly 5 million people. Then, the merciful US demonstrated an incredible act of restraint, offering Mexico a chance to surrender immediately. If Mexico did not do so, the US would then detonate two more atomic bombs: one in Cancun, and one in Tijuana. Quickly, Mexico surrendered, bringing an end to the years long bloodshed that plagued North America. Finally, the London treaty was signed in June of 1975, bringing a formal end to the Cold War, and retracting Mexico’s borders back to the Rio Grande. 
                    Years later, The US and Mexico have put their quarrels aside, in order to strengthen national security for both countries. But, security at the border has long been an issue of national security. In December of 2023, the US Border Patrol reported nearly 250,000 encounters of migrants attempting to cross the border. Many of these people are asylum seekers, who hope to live out the American Dream, and escape issues that have plagued their homes such as violence and corruption.

            <h2>How are human thoughts limited by language and its lack of words?</h2>
            <p>
                Ministry of Truth
                    Have you ever felt that feeling when you just can’t think of the word? You have such an intense thought, but no way to express it? The question that bothers me is, what if there is a whole realm of these thoughts, laying somewhere, beyond the reach of our limited minds?
                Diving into the linguistic elements of this question, there is actually a term for the argument that thought is directly correlated with the language of an individual, Linguistic Determinism. This is a smaller section of a wider argument, around the central theme that humans preserve the world through the structure of language that they use, commonly referred to as Linguistic Relativism. 
                Guugu Yimithirr, is a language that lays at the heart of Linguistic Relativism arguments. In the language, there is no concept of left and right, rather everything is viewed in its geocentric direction (North, East, South, West). Speakers of this language are able to identify the geocentric direction of people, places and things with incredible accuracy and memory. This indicates that the way in which their language is formatting, changes the structure of how they remember details and what details they remember. Or in other words, this is an example in which the language of the individual alters or slights the way in which said individual preserves things. 
                Pirahã, is a language that originates from the Amazon, in which the concept of math, seemed to researchers to be out of the realm of the language. The language only contains words for “none”, “some” and many”, but lacks any numerical system or math. Native speakers were taught for eight months, and by the end, were still incapable of counting from one to ten. Which reaffirms the theory that language might actually hinder thought, or at least the understanding of thought. But, notably, they were taught to count from one to ten in Portuguese, this isolates the fact that language restricts the ability to think. A more refined thesis would be that the native tongue of an individual inhibits that individual's understanding of certain concepts. 
                Unfortunately, this point of language limiting thought is actually denounced by a majority of linguisticians. They make the argument that just because there isn’t exactly a word for something does not mean that there is not a way of expressing it. For example, I cannot give you one word to describe how much I love my dog, I would need a few sentences to do so. 
                Philosophically, the famous philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, seemed in his works to agree with the Linguistic Determinism theory, in which he coined the phrase “Language as a prison.” 
                A modern example of this is the newly revamped word, “gaslight”, which has come to express the relationship of a perpetrator, conscious of their wrongdoing, denying, advertising or in any way dodging the direct confrontation of their victim. The term has been so widely used, mainly due to its word-economy advantages, as it drastically reduced the amount of words required to describe such a feeling.

            <h2> The War on Terror in the Middle East, and the US's Involvement</h2>
            <p>     Baghdad, Iraq - Years after the Iraq war that began twenty one years ago, the claim of “weapons of mass destruction” persists in the memory of the world. Even with the fog of war and the hind sight that comes with looking at an event twenty years ago, we must not forget the effects of the rules based order that the U. S. upheld in Iraq.</p>

                <p>    This Peace coming from Saddam Husseins’s Iraq will never attain “WMDs” and therefore append the rules based global order that the U.S. gained so much from. Clearly, this truth must be known to fully comprehend the reason why our nation started a war with a country across the world. This world, based on the rule of law and justice, needs violence to uphold these values we hold fiercely. Operation Iraqi Freedom proves the necessity within American foreign policy to uphold freedom and democracy to only one country despite all the countries in the world having some human rights issues. Ultimately, the average American that ultimately paid the most, and continues to pay the developing nations who must choose these tyrannical governments which call upon America to liberate them. It ultimately is up to these nations to choose whether or not they want humanitarian crises, war crimes and protracted societal collapse by arbitrarily violating the mandates of the most preeminent global power. </p>
                
               <p>    The Iraqis should be grateful for the "any means necessary" doctrine, as only limited the amount of “illegal detainment, torture and psyops such as collective punishment”. We “were greeted as liberators” despite killing a million innocents, and being charged with physical abuse, sexual humiliation, physical and psychological torture, and rape, as well the killing desecration of bodies. Ultimately our ignorance is strength to further our resolve in freeing the Iraqi people, even though the American public didn’t know about these necessary events. Many people criticized this war for taking away any sort of popular sovereignty from the Iraqi people, however I say that there is no difference between a brutal native authoritarian government vs. a liberating occupying authoritarian government. There is no difference between freedom and slavery for the Iraqi people, therefore why shouldn't we force our ideology onto them. In the end, Twenty One years later, we should be grateful for this war and the lasting credibility and as we went from. Just as our president who led us through this war said “Absolutely, we’re winning.' Two months later, he told the Washington Post: 'We’re not winning, we’re not losing”. </p>
